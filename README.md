# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study for X Education
Problem Statement - 

Objective
X Education, an online course provider, struggles with a low lead conversion rate (~30%). To optimize the sales process, we aim to develop a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion and assign a lead score (0-100), helping the sales team focus on high-potential leads. The target conversion rate is set at 80%.

Approach
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns.
Replace "Select" in categorical variables as it represents missing data.
Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify key factors influencing lead conversion (e.g., lead source, time spent on website, last activity).
Visualize trends using bar charts, heatmaps, and histograms.
Model Building

Train a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion.
Perform feature selection using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination).
Optimize using grid search for hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation

Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Assign lead scores based on predicted probabilities.
Expected Deliverables
Jupyter notebook with data processing, model building, and evaluation.
Word document with solutions to company-specific challenges.
Presentation (PPT) summarizing key findings, insights, and recommendations.
500-word report on the analysis approach, results, and learnings.
